# LedgerX Build Progress

Status legend: `[ ]` not started · `[~]` in progress · `[x]` complete

## Phases

- [x] Phase 1 — Repository structure and architecture
- [x] Phase 2 — Shared kernel and domain models
- [x] Phase 3 — Database persistence (EF models; `MigrateOrCreateAsync` until committed migrations)
- [x] Phase 4 — Identity / authentication
- [x] Phase 5 — Accounts
- [x] Phase 6 — Ledger engine
- [x] Phase 7 — Transfers / payments
- [x] Phase 8 — Transactional outbox and Kafka
- [x] Phase 9 — Redis / idempotency
- [x] Phase 10 — Audit / notification / projection workers
- [x] Phase 11 — Blazor customer application
- [x] Phase 12 — Operations dashboard
- [x] Phase 13 — Observability (OTel hooks, health, meters)
- [x] Phase 14 — Tests (domain + application + architecture compile; integration needs Docker)
- [x] Phase 15 — Docker Compose + Aspire AppHost
- [x] Phase 16 — Documentation and GitHub polish
